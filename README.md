Shader #1: Scrolling Texture

I decided to use a scrolling texture for the sky background to make the simulation more realistic and help the player feel like they are actually moving in the scene. It also adds a dynamic feeling to the game which is always great at keeping player retention higher. 

Shader #2: Toon Ramping

Toon ramping was applied to the Goombas to match the theme of the game. Mario games follow a very cartoony style and the games often thrive on the fact that it mainly uses flat colours to accentuate a unrealistic artstyle. As goombas are a staple enemy of mario games, I decided to add toon ramping to further emphasize this fact of the mario games. 

Shader #3: Rim Lighting

Rim lighting was the second shader addition of choice. This was applied to another enemy type which is the koopas. This was done to help accentuate and help attract the players attention to this enemy. I decided to do it in the koopas because in mario games this turtle often doesn't die the moment the player jumps or detroys it. The koopa normally hopes into its shell and can sin around the map hitting players if they don't destroy it again. Because of this fact, I decided to particularly highlight this enemy as one players need to keep watch for which is done with the rim lighitng. 

Shader #4: Colour Correction

*NOTE*: The capsule the colour grading is applied to becomes invisble if the scrolling textur is on and applied to the sky for some reason and i'm not really sure how to fix it so if you want to view the shader when opening the project you will need to disable the background plane. 

I added a darker colour grading LUT to the last enemy to simulate a dark theme to the game overall as shooting and killing enemies with a super scope is a rather evil and bad intention that you normally wouldn't think of the main character mario doing.
